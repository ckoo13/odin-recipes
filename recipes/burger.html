    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Go on and take a bite of this juicy burger. Stacked high 
        with crunchy pickles, crispy bacon and creamy coleslaw 
        and oozing with not one, but two melted cheeses and topped 
        off with a generous dollop of ketchup, every mouthful tastes 
        amazing. Now that’s what makes this the best burger ever.</p>

        <li>1 beef tomato, sliced into 8</li>
        <li>4 tsp tomato ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For Cucumber</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cucumber, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>50ml white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>½ tsp mustard seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For the coleslaw</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>¼ white cabbage, sliced</li>
        <li>½ carrot, grated</li>
        <li>¼ onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ tbsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tbsp crème fraîche</li>
        <li>few chives, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>To make the pickled cucumber, put the sliced cucumber in a bowl. 
            Sprinkle with ¼ tsp salt, toss to combine and leave for 15 mins. 
            Rinse and squeeze out any excess water. Meanwhile, heat the vinegar, 
            sugar and mustard seeds in a small pan for 2-3 mins, until the sugar 
            has dissolved. Remove from the heat and pour over the cucumber. Leave 
            for at least 15 mins, or overnight, if possible. Store the pickle in a 
            lidded container in the fridge until ready to use (it will keep for up to 
            1 week).</li>
        <li>To make the coleslaw, mix the cabbage, carrot and onion in a bowl. 
            Stir through the mayonnaise, crème fraîche and chopped chives. Season 
            to taste, then cover and set aside in the fridge while you make the 
            burger.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the onion, garlic, thyme and beef mince with the egg 
            yolk, mustard, Parmesan and a little seasoning. Mix thoroughly, then form 
            into 4 thick patties (just smaller than the diameter of the bun).</li>
        <li>Preheat the barbecue to medium-high and cook the bacon for 2 mins on 
            each side, or until crisp and golden. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the burgers for 5 mins on one side, until golden. Turn them over, 
            put the cheese on top and close the barbecue lid (or cover with a metal 
            container if your barbecue doesn’t have a lid) to help the cheese melt. 
            Cook for 5 mins, or until the burgers are cooked through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, toast the cut sides of the brioche bun halves on the barbecue 
            bars. Put the bottom bun halves on a board, top each with lettuce, tomato, 
            a beef patty, a slice of bacon and a portion each of pickled cucumber and 
            coleslaw. Spread the ketchup and mustard onto the top bun halves, then add 
            to the top of the burger stack. Put a skewer through the top of the burger 
            to hold it all together when serving.</li>
