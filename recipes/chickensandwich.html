        The recipe makes 6 chicken sandwiches and the chicken patties reheat well in case
        you want to save them for next time.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 medium chicken breasts, boneless, skinless, halved into 6 cutlets</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups low-fat buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp hot sauce, (we use Frank’s Red Hot brand)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper, freshly ground</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>Oil for frying - vegetable oil, canola oil or peanut oil</li>
        <li>6 burger buns, buttered and toasted</li>
        <li>6 green lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>2 dill pickles, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise, or your favorite sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Pound chicken cutlets between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound to 
            an even 1/2” thickness so they cook more evenly.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together marinade ingredients. Add 
            Chicken, turning to coat then cover and refrigerate for 2-4 hours or 
            overnight.</li>
        <li>In a separate shallow bowl, whisk together breading ingredients: 
            flour, salt, pepper, baking powder, paprika, onion powder and garlic 
            powder. Remove a piece of chicken from the marinade, letting excess 
            drip off and dip chicken into flour mixture, pressing it on with your 
            hands to coat well. Transfer to a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 ” oil in a soup pot or dutch oven to 350˚F. Just before frying 
            chicken, dip it into the seasoned flour again for a thick and shaggy 
            exterior.Add chicken, 2 pieces at a time for a smaller pot so you don’t 
            crowd and reduce the temperature of the oil too quickly.</li>
        <li>Place chicken into the oil one by one. Adjust the flame to keep the oil 
            temperature at 300-325˚F. Cook 3-4 minutes on the first side or until 
            browned and crisp then flip and cook another 2-3 minutes on the second 
            side or until cooked through and chicken is browned and crisp all over.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. The internal temperature 
            ll continue to rise as it rests. The final resting temperature of the 
            chicken should reach 165˚F.</li>
        <li>Lightly butter and toast the cut sides of your buns and build your crispy 
            chicken sandwiches with desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
