    <h1>Calamari Marinara</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Calamari has an unfair reputation for being tricky to work with
        and that it's rubbery when cooked. Here's the secret: cook it 
        in 45 seconds or 45 minutes--very quickly or a long slow simmer. 
        For this marinara dish, I use the long simmer method.
    </p>
    
    <p>By following this recipe you'll be able to create a tangy
        calamari marinara dish that will make you feel like you are
        tasting authentic Italian cuisine by the seaside.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Yellow Onion, sliced thin</li>
        <li>1 Serrano Chile Pepper, sliced thin</li>
        <li>3 Garlic Cloves, crushed or minced</li>
        <li>1 Anchovy Fillet</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup clam juice</li>
        <li>6 cups crushed or pureed Italian plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 pounds frozen calamari (tubes and tentacles), thawed, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup freshly chopped Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry pasta</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Drizzle olive oil into saucepan (not over heat). Add onions, 
            Serrano pepper, garlic, anchovy filet, red pepper flakes, and 
            salt. Place pot over medium-high heat. When onions start to 
            sizzle after a minute or so, stir and cook until onions and garlic 
            just start to turn golden, 3 or 4 minutes. Stir in wine.</li>
        <li>Cook until wine is reduced by about half, 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Add clam juice, tomatoes, and oregano. Bring to a simmer over 
            medium-high heat. When sauce begins to bubble, reduce heat to 
            medium-low. Simmer gently for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer calamari to sauce pot; stir gently. Simmer until 
            calamari are tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from heat. 
            Stir in parsley.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally 
            until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. 
            Drain.</li>
        <li>Stir some sauce into the hot, drained pasta. Serve in warm 
            bowls topped with more marinara sauce and grated cheese.</li>
    </ol>
